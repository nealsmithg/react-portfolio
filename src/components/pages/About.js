        I am currently back at school working on my Professional Certificate
        from UNC-Chapel Hill in their coding bootcamp. I am seeking my passion
        in coding and trying to find my next career path. I have been interested
        in coding for a long time but finally had time to pursue this interest.
        In my past life I was in the restaurant service industry which I had
        been in for 13 years. In my 13 years I had worked my way up to manager
        in every restaurant that I had been in. I try to prove myself at every
        position I am in and enjoy learning and furthering my work knowledge and
        work responsibilities. I hope to find my next company that I can prove
        myself in and show that I and deserving of those promotions and
        responsibilities.
