# react-portfolio

## Description

For this project I am turning my portfolio webpage into a react website in order to show my new skills in making a react website. For this I started with the base react webpage using `npx create-react-app .` I had created my repository before freating the react app so I used the `.` to signify that I wanted to create the app in the curent folder rather then including a folder name for the app to be created in.
